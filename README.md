## 🚀 Vision & Innovation
**Kinematic-Voice AI** transforms standard smartphones into clinical-grade diagnostic tools. By analyzing the **kinematic gestures** of the vocal apparatus, our platform identifies micro-tremors and stablity patterns invisible to the human ear but critical for the early detection of neurodegenerative conditions.

### Key Scientific Pillars:
* 🔬 **Kinematic Analysis**: We move beyond simple acoustics to study the motor "gestures" of the vocal folds.
* ⚡ **Edge-AI Computing**: Real-time signal processing directly on the device ensures 10ms inference speed and total data sovereignty.
* 🔒 **Privacy by Design**: GDPR and EU AI Act compliant. Biometric data is encrypted and processed locally.
* 📉 **Healthcare Impact**: A 90% reduction in screening costs and improved patient monitoring at home.

## 👥 Scientific & Technical Leadership
Our team combines high-level AI engineering with clinical strategy:

* **Leonardo Tronci** – *Team Lead & AI Architect*. Specialized in signal processing (3rd Prize, EmoPet World AI Competition).
* **Prof. Tiziana Mori** – *Scientific & Clinical Validation Director*. Lead for WP5 clinical integration and medical stakeholder engagement.
* **Massimiliano Tronci** – *Legal & Environmental Advisor*. Ensuring compliance with international medical device regulations.

---

## 📊 Clinical Validation (WP5)
Vital-Tronic is not just an app; it is a clinical tool. 
* **Medical Consensus**: Validated through a pilot survey with **10 medical specialists**.
* **Target Accuracy**: Designed to meet the **92% sensitivity** standard established in international literature (e.g., Max Little et al.) for vocal tremor detection.
* **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and clinical workstations using **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📂 Project Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1 (Oostende Hackathon)**: Proof of Concept & Technical Validation.
2.  **Phase 2**: Completion of the WP5 Clinical Deliverables.
3.  **Phase 3**: CE/MDR Certification as a Class IIa Medical Device.
